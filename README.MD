# DevDenBot

The official main Discord Bot for the
[Developer Den](https://developerden.org/discord) Discord Server.

## Building

### Building for Development

Development building skips linting checks and avoids compilation for faster
prototyping. By default, it is [configured](/src/Config.ts) to use roles and
channels from the DevDen Testing server. Invitations to this server are given on
request to avoid spam. Its use is recommended, as setting up your own testing
server can be tedious.

- Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn watch-dev` to start the bot, automatically reloading on changes. If
  this isn't desired, you can use `yarn build-and-run` to build and run the bot
  once, without automatic reloading.

### Building for Production

Production building runs linting checks and compiles the bot for production use.
This is mainly for our CI process, so it's unlikely that contributors will need
to use this.

It also uses the [Config.prod.ts](/src/Config.prod.ts) for configuration, which
by default, uses attributes from the real DevDen server. Obviously, this will
not be usable without the real bot token, so you will need to change these
attributes if you want to test in production.

- Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies
- Run `yarn build-prod` to build for production
- Optionally, use `yarn start-built` to run the bot after building

### Docker

We use [Nixpacks](https://nixpacks.com/docs/getting-started) to manage creation
of a Docker image. To build a docker image, run `nixpacks build .`

### Nix

This project also has a Nix file to set up a reproducible development
environment. To access this, run `nix-shell`.

## Running

The bot requires 2 things to run:

- A Discord bot token, defined in the `BOT_TOKEN` environment variable
- A SQL Database (optional). If no database settings are defined, the bot will
  run an in-memory SQLite database.

### Configuring a Database

To configure the bot to use a real SQL database (recommended), define the
following environment variables:

- `DDB_HOST` - The hostname of the database. Mandatory, probably `localhost`
- `DDB_PORT` - The port of the database. Optional, defaults to `3306`
- `DDB_DATABASE` - The name of the database. Optional, defaults to `database`
- `DDB_USERNAME` - The username to use when connecting to the database. Optional,
  defaults to `root`
- `DDB_PASSWORD` - The password to use when connecting to the database. Optional,
  defaults to `password`
- `DDB_DIALECT` - The SQL dialect to use. Optional, defaults to `postgres`. Must be a
  valid [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) dialect. You may need to install
  additional dependencies to use some dialects.
